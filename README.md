# NES Emulator
This project is a personal project created in order to learn the Rust programming language, 
as well as learning how emulators are being implemented in general.

The content of this project is largely based on an online 
[e-book by Rafael Bagmanov](https://bugzmanov.github.io/nes_ebook/) with very little modifications.

This project is made for personal and recreational programming purpose only. Please do not use it 
for any other pupose other than learning rust and understanding how emulators works.
